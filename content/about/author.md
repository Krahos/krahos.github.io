Hi reader, my name is Sebastiano Giordano, I studied computer engineering
and management engineering at Polytechnic University of Turin, I'm currently
employed at DHL Data & Analytics as software engineer and Rust specialist.

I've worked in the software industry for about 10 years now and I'm interested
in the whole lifecycle of software products, from requirements analysis, to
deployment. Nowadays I'm mainly focused on the Rust programming language and its
ecosystem. Rust is not a silver bullet one can write everything with, but lately
I tend to prefer those problems where Rust can actually be a great choice.
