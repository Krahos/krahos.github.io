# Seb's blog

Hi, welcome to my blog! This is a space where I collect some personal (and
possibly opinionated) notes about some topics I care about, mainly about
software development in general and related fields. I will try to quote the
sources and provide demonstrations for whatever I write here, however, readers
are invited to use their own judgement and critical thinking, as they always
should.
Any idea or opinion shared here is my own and doesn't reflect statements and
opinions of my employers or other organizations and groups I might be part of.
